Before USC, I was studying at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm">Tsinghua University</a>. I also worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Graphics & Geometric Computing Group</a> from 2017 to 2019, advised by <a href="https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/#people.htm">Prof. Shimin Hu</a>.
