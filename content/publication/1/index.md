abstract: We present a data-driven approach to reconstructing highresolution and detailed volumetric representations of 3D shapes. Although well studied, algorithms for volumetric fusion from multi-view depth scans are still prone to scanning noise and occlusions, making it hard to obtain high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. In this paper, inspired by recent advances in efficient 3D deep learning techniques, we introduce a novel cascaded 3D convolutional network architecture, which learns to reconstruct implicit surface representations from noisy and incomplete depth maps in a progressive, coarse-to-fine manner. To this end, we also develop an algorithm for end-to-end training of the proposed cascaded structure. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art work in terms of quality and fidelity of reconstructed models.
